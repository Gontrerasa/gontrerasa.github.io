I hold a DPhil in Politics from the University of Oxford. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Inter-American Policy & Research (CIPR), Tulane University, and an Adjunct Researcher at the Núcleo Milenio para el Estudio de la Política, Opinión Pública y Medios en Chile (MEPOP).

My research agenda is in the field of Comparative Politics, with a particular interest in the politics of representation, political organizations, democratic accountability, and citizen involvement in politics. My work has been published or is forthcoming in *Comparative Political Studies*, *Democratization*, *Electoral Studies*, *Policy Studies*, *Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies*, *Política y Gobierno*, and *Revista de Ciencia Política*, among other journals. You can see all my articles on my [research page]. (https://gontrerasa.github.io/publications/) 

My book project, titled Clientelism Without Party Machines: The Logic of Clientelism for Programmatic Parties, provides a framework to understand how parties, lacking the features of party machines, can still include clientelism as an electoral strategy by outsourcing the organizational capacity and territorial control of local associations.

My framework explains how parties without strong roots in society, and facing acute representation crises, can use the rich topography of civil society organizations to their advantage, profiting from their territorial control and connections with otherwise disengaged citizens. Overall, the project contributes to the literature on political representation, distributive politics, clientelism, and the engagement of civic associations in the political process.
